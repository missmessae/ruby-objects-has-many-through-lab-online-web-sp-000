class Appointment
  @@all = []

  def initialize(date, patient, doctor)
    
  
  The Appointment class needs a class method .all that lists each Appointment in the class variable.

  An Appointment should be initialized with a date 
  (as a string, like "Monday, August 1st"), a patient, and a doctor in this order. 
  The Appointment should be saved in the @@all array.
